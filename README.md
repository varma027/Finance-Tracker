## 🧩 Key Components

- `FinanceTracker.tsx`: Main app page that manages state, forms, tabs, currency, and persistence.  
- `TransactionChart.tsx`: Line/area chart of transaction flow over time.  
- `CategoryChart.tsx`: Pie/donut chart of expenses by category.  
- Shadcn UI components: Card, Tabs, Select, Button, Input, Label, Badge.  

## 📈 How It Works

1. **State & Persistence**: Transactions are stored in React state and synced to `localStorage` under the key `finance-transactions`.  
2. **Exchange Rates**: On load, the app fetches USD-based rates and stores them in state. All displayed values convert using the selected currency rate.  
3. **Validation**: Forms validate amount, category, and description to prevent invalid entries.  
4. **Analytics**:  
   - Balance = total income − total expenses.  
   - Category totals sum only expense transactions for the pie chart.  
   - Transaction timeline visualizes cash flow trends.

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- **Budgeting**: Track monthly spending vs income with quick visual summaries.  
- **Multi-currency View**: Instantly see balances in INR/EUR/GBP and more.  
- **Spending Insights**: Identify top expense categories to optimize costs.  
- **Learning Project**: Demonstrates practical React patterns with UI and charts.

## 🔐 Privacy

- All data is stored in the browser via `localStorage`.  
- No server-side storage is used by default.
